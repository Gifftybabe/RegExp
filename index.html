        /*
        Question One!
            For each of the following items, write a regular expression to test whether any
            of the given substrings occur in a string. The regular expression should match
            only strings containing one of the substrings described. Do not worry about
            word boundaries unless explicitly mentioned. When your expression works, see
            whether you can make it any smaller.
            1. car and cat
            2. pop and prop
            3. ferret, ferry, and ferrari
            4. Any word ending in ious
            5. A whitespace character followed by a period, comma, colon, or semicolon
            6. A word longer than six letters
            7. A word without the letter e (or E)
            Refer to the table in the chapter summary for help. Test each solution with
            a few test strings.

        Question Two
            Imagine you have written a story and used single quotation marks throughout
            to mark pieces of dialogue. Now you want to replace all the dialogue quotes
            with double quotes, while keeping the single quotes used in contractions like
            aren’t.
            Think of a pattern that distinguishes these two kinds of quote usage and
            craft a call to the replace method that does the proper replacement.

           /*
        Question Three
           Write an expression that matches only JavaScript-style numbers. It must sup-
            port an optional minus or plus sign in front of the number, the decimal dot,

            and exponent notation—5e-3 or 1E10—again with an optional sign in front of
            the exponent. Also note that it is not necessary for there to be digits in front
            of or after the dot, but the number cannot be a dot alone. That is, .5 and 5.
            are valid JavaScript numbers, but a lone dot isn’t.
